Flex box is a method that can be used to display content in responsive way by either rows or columns.

Flex box gives you the flexiable to control the space between each object, can the order of objects, and how content can grow or shrink when the viewport changes size.

To use flex box add display flex in the parent container.

```
.flex-div {
    display: flex;
}
```

You can then add more properties to the parent container to control the content, or to each individual container.
