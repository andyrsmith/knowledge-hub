# Note Taking

Taking notes is important because if we don't write it down then it will be very likely that it will be forgotten.

## What you will need

I suggest getting a note book and a pen.  You could use a digital method like evernote, or whatever software to capture the notes, but I personally like just capturing notes by hand first.

I like the Leuchtturm 1917 notebook.  I have used this notebook for years and I still enjoy it.

I would also recommond purchasing a smaller pocket size notebook that can be stowed in your pocket for times you don't want to carry your normal size notebook.  I purchase this pack of 5 Field Book notebook for $10 on Amazon.

Field Notes notebook is also good as well, but those cost just a little bit more.

## Steps in Note Taking

For each day I write today's date.  This lets me know what day it is when the note was taken.

Follow these steps when note taking.

### 1. Write it down

As ideas come into your head you write them down.  These could be ideas for a project, something that you want to learn more of, notes from something you read or watch, task, or maybe it is some habit that you want to track.  Whatever it is just write it down. If you don't write it down then there is a good chance you will forget it.

### 2. Origanize

Once you have a break go back to what you have written and see if it needs to be origanized.

#### Task

If the note is a task and can be done in 2 minutes then you should just do it now to get it done.  If not then ask yourself when does this need to be done by.  Does it need to be done today, then check to see whatelse you already have planed for and schedule it to be done that day.  If it needs to be done this week, then keep a list of task to complete this week and move it there, or maybe it is a month.  If the task is something that isn't important but is something that you would like to complete then keep a list call a someday list.

As you are figuring out where to move these task to also ask yourself if this task can be broken down into smaller task.  Maybe this is a project instead of just one task. The smaller the task is the easier it is to tell when you will be done, so that will make it easier for you to schedule.

#### Information

Then other note is a information note. This could be notes that you took about something you read or watch, ideas for what you want to learn, habit tracking, random thoughts, or just anything that comes into your head.  For these types of notes ask yourself if this note is in the correct location.  If not then move that note to the place where you keep that piece of information.  Like maybe you are learning different algorithms and you have a notebook or another specific place where you have all those notes live.  Maybe you are collecting qoutes and you want that all in one place, or a notebook of different project idea.  You might also feel too that there isn't a place for this note to go yet, and that is fine too.  You might not know at first how to origanize and you might have to wait to see what kind of notes you take in the future to see what goes togather. 

Ask yourself what is the output of your idea.  Maybe this idea can be turned into a blog, or the project that you do can be shared with others.

As you do the next steps reflect you might discover that you have taken notes on one subject that would be better if they were in the same place, so at first if you don't know where thiss note goes just leave it where it is.

### 3. Reflect

The last step is to reflect on the notes that you have taken.  This could just be reviewing informration that you want to remember or you might find notes that go togather and can be origanized in a differnt place like in step 2.   Also check on task to see if any moved up or down in importantance, or there could be a task that no longer needs to be done and can be crossed out.  You might have a different type of reflection that happens daily/monthly/quarterly.  Reflecting on these notes might generate other ideas.

The steps of origanize and reflect take time, but you need to take the time in order to learn and to keep you on track of what is important in your live.
