# Note Taking

Taking notes is important because if we don't write it down then it will be very likely that it will be forgotten.

## What you will need

I suggest getting a note book and a pen.  You could use a digital method like evernote, or whatever software to capture the notes, but I personally like just capturing notes by hand first.

I like the Leuchtturm 1917 notebook.  I have used this notebook for years and I still enjoy it.

I would also recommond purchasing a smaller pocket size notebook that can be stowed in your pocket for times you don't want to carry your normal size notebook.  I purchase this pack of 5 Field Book notebook for $10 on Amazon.

Field Notes notebook is also good as well, but those cost just a little bit more.

## Steps in Note Taking

For each day I write today's date.  This lets me know what day it is when the note was taken.

Follow these steps when note taking.

### 1. Write it down

As ideas come into your head you write them down.  These could be ideas for a project, something that you want to learn more of, notes from something you read or watch, task, or maybe it is some habit that you want to track.  This could be anything. Whatever it is just write it down, and continue with what you were originally doing. If you don't write it down then there is a good chance you will forget it.  

### 2. Origanize

Once you have a break go back to what you have written and see if it needs to be origanized. Is it a task then determine if it can be done now or scheduled for a different time.  If it is information or an idea do you need to move this item to a place where you keep all of your notes on that subject. 

Maybe it is fine where it is and nothing needs to be done right now.

### 3. Reflect

Come back to your notes and task and review what you have.  You can do this in place of scrolling on social media.  This could generate new ideas or questions you have.  For task you can ask yourself if you still need to do it.
