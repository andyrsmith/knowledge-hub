# C Arrays

Arrays in C can be initialized by just providing the size of the array.

```
int num[3];
```

or can be initialized with values

```
int num = [1,2,3];
```

Most programming languages will have a length method or property that can be call on arrays.  C does not have this.  When looping through the array need to know how big that array is.
